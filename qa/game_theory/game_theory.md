# Basics of Game Theory

## Define weakly/strongly dominate for a strategy

strategy s1 weakly dominates s2 for player i when every outcome (s1*) in s1 is pereferable or at least as as good as every outcome (s2*) in s2 . (strongly, only prefereable)

## Nash Equilibrium

assuming player i plays s1, player j can do no better than play s2
assuming player j plays s2, player i can do no better than play s1

no incentive to deviate from Nash equilibrium

## What is the Nash equilibrium in Prisoner's Dilemma

(D, D) both defect is the Nash equilibrium because defect for any player guarantees a payoff of 2 (2, 5) unlike cooperate which guarantees 0 (0, 3)

## What is the Nash equilibrium in Stag Hunt

    D       C
D (1, 1) (2, 0)
C (0, 2) (3, 3)

(C, C), (D, D)
assuming other plays C you can do no better than play C
assuming other plays D you can do no better than play D

## What is the Nash equilibrium in Game of Chicken

    D       C
D (0, 0) (3, 1)
C (1, 3) (2, 2)

(D, C), (C, D)
assuming other plays C you can do no better than play D
assuming other plays D you can do no better than play C
